<h2>...me:</h2>
<p>My name is Roman and I'm a 25 year old Data Engineer based in Munich. During my spare time I try to become a better Software Engineer by improving my coding game step by step. This blog includes topics according to my current needs and interests in the wide field of Data- and Software Engineering plus my day to day usage of Linux. My current focus and interest is mostly about topics related to machine learning as well as functional programming. I'm also a bit into Devops stuff lately, that's why I have started to love containers.<p>
<p>Hope you Enjoy.<p>
