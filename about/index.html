<h2>...me:</h2>
<p>Hi, I am Roman, a Data Engineer based in Munich. Currently I strongly focus on topics related to distributed systems, stream processing, concurrency, and functional programming. Also I am into DevOps and infrastructure stuff. That's where my passion for containers and the power of Docker is rooted. Personal growth as well as continuous self- and competence improvement are essential for me. For this reason, I use most of my free time to work on my algorithmic skills and overall programming game. Gradually, I want to add content to my blog regarding current topics of interest in the wide field of Data- and Software Engineering.<p>

<p>This site is built with <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and is hosted on <a target="_blank" href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>. I used the Jekyll <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/sergiokopplin/indigo">Indigo</a> Theme and changed it a little for my needs. You can find the whole code on my Github <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/romanskie/romanskie.github.io">Repo</a>.<p>
