<h2>...me:</h2>
<p>My name is Roman and I'm a 26 year old Data Engineer based in Munich. During my spare time I try to become a better Software Engineer by improving my algorithmic skills and overall coding game step by step. Soon this blog will hopefully include topics according to my current interests in the wide field of Data- and Software Engineering. My main focus is currently on topics related to distributed systems, stream processing, concurrency and functional programming (Scala/Clojure). I'm also a bit into Devops stuff lately, that's why I started to love containers and the power of Docker.<p>
<p>Hope you Enjoy.<p>
